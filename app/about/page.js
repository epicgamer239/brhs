              This website is created and run by the <strong className="text-foreground">Code4Community club at Broad Run High School</strong> (Loudoun County Public Schools). 
              We are a student-led club: the people who build and maintain this site are club members and the executive board. 
              All tools and content here are produced by our club as part of our activities at Broad Run.

              Code4Community was started by students who wanted to build software that the school could actually use. 
              We build tools like grade calculators, seating charts, and yearbook formatting that support teaching and learning.

              This project aligns with our academic and career goals: we learn by doing. We design and code real 
              applications, work with users (students and teachers), and maintain the site, which gives us experience 
              in software development while providing the school with practical, free tools.

            <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              We provide a lot of educational value for our users by creating custom and tailor made applications
              designed to help students learn and become more productive in learning with tools such as yearbook
              caption formatters that can save students a lot of time. Additionally, more tools are on the way such as content practices like activities to help retain and practice subject matter taught in classrooms.
